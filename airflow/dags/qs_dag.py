from airflow.operators import QueryServiceOperator

# This is an example DAG which uses the QueryServiceOperator.
# In this example, we create two tasks which execute sequentially.
# The first task is to run a notebook at the workspace path "/test"
# and the second task is to run a JAR uploaded to DBFS. Both,
# tasks use new clusters.
#
# Because we have set a downstream dependency on the notebook task,
# the spark jar task will NOT run until the notebook task completes
# successfully.
#
# The definition of a succesful run is if the run has a result_state of "SUCCESS".
# For more information about the state of a run refer to
# https://docs.Query Service.com/api/latest/jobs.html#runstate
